                    helps us build opinions and have points of view on things in life. People debate over
                    the subject of whether education is the only thing that gives knowledge.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-secsmall">Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary
            education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as
            a high school or secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and
            postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. Colleges and universities mainly
            provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. 
            Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic 
            degrees.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-secsmall">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the 
            knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved 
            orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation
            to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
            through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
            Kingdom.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Education is the key to success</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-secsmall">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition 
            of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
            storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance
            of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or
            informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or 
            acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>
